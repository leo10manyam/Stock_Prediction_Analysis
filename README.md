# Stock Market Analysis with EMA100 and EMA200
This project provides a simple analysis of stock price trends using the 100-day and 200-day Exponential Moving Averages (EMA100 and EMA200). By applying these indicators to historical stock data, the project helps identify potential buy and sell signals, making it easier to spot trends and possible market reversals.

Overview

This project allows users to input a stock ticker, fetch its historical data, and visualize these EMAs alongside the stockâ€™s closing price. Crossovers between EMA100 and EMA200 indicate potential trend changes that can serve as trading signals.
